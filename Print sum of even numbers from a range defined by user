#this program will take a range (two numbers) from user and will print the sum of only even numbers within that range

x = int(input("give a number "))   #takes a number as first end point
y = int(input("give a number "))  #takes a number as first end point
sum = 0                           
while x<=y:                     # while loop to sum
    if x%2==0:                  # if-statement so it only adds even numbers
        sum=sum+x
    x+=1
print(sum)                      #printing sum
